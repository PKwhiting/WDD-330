 - Using CSS transform() changes the state, position and structure of elements, especially during events such as mouseovers.
 - Transform() allows you to move, tilt, rotate and skew elements in the X and Y axes.
 - CSS transform() has two properties: transform and transform-origin.
 - Transform-origin is responsible for transforming elements and positioning them on the x, y, and z axes. 
  - Source units include left, right, center, top, bottom, and %.
 - Translate() moves an element from its current position to another position according to the X and Y axis parameters.
 - The rotate() function rotates an element around the origin by the specified angle value.
 - Transition property allows multiple transitions in one call.
 - To animate an element with CSS, first create a named animation and attach it to the element within that element's property declaration block. 
 - The animation itself does nothing. To animate an element, you have to link the animation to it.
 - Use the animation-delay property to specify the number of milliseconds or seconds the browser should wait before starting an animation.
 - How do you add multiple transformations to a single into a single transform property?
 - Is it possible to use multiple key-frames inside an animation property?
 - Can you make animations repeat forever?
 - Canvas lets you draw shapes and lines, arcs and text, gradients and patterns.
 - The canvas element requires both width and height attributes, which must also be set.
 - All drawing on the canvas is done using the Canvas JavaScript API
 - Paths create blueprints for lines, arcs and shapes, but paths are not visible until stroked
 - API You can use the toDataURL method to create a save for your drawing. 
 - You can draw images into a container created in RaphaÃ«l.
 - SVG graphics take up less memory
 - <svg></svg>
 - SVG is better optimied for bigger screens
 - Canvas does not support event handlers.
 - SVG images are extensible and scalable
 - Drag and drop events:
    -dragstart
    -drag
    -dragenter
    -dragleave
    -dragover
    -drop
    -dragend
 - Which one is better for gaming applications?
 - If JS is not enables on a page will the images fail to render?
 - Which provides better and faster performance?
